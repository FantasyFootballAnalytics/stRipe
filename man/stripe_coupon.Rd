stripe_coupon
}
\description{
The \code{stripe_coupon} object represents the complete set of data required
to manage coupons at Stripe. A coupon has either a \code{percent_off} or an
\code{amount_off} and \code{currency}. If you set an \code{amount_off}, that
amount will be subtracted from any invoiceâ€™s subtotal. For example, an invoice
with a subtotal of $100 will have a final total of $0 if a coupon with an
\code{amount_off} of 20000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of
$300 will have a final total of $100 if a coupon with an \code{amount_off} of
20000 is applied to it.
